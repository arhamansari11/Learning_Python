# Operators

# There are 4 types of Operators.

# 1-> Arithemetic Operators.

# a = 12
# b = 2
# print(a + b)
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)
# print(a // b)
# print(a ** b)
# print(a % b)



# 2-> Assignment Operators

a = 6
b = 3
# a += b    
# print(a)
# a -= b
# print(a)
# a *= b
# print(a)
# a /= b
# print(a)
# a //= b
# print(a)
# a **= b
# print(a)
# a %= b
# print(a)


# 3-> Comparison Operators

# a = 18
# b = 9

# print(a > b)
# print(a < b)
# print(a == b)


# 4-> Logical Operators

# a = 8
# b = 23
# c = 43

# print(a > b and a > c)
# print (b > c or c > b)
# print(not(True))
# print(not(False))
